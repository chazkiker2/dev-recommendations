## Notes of Preface

### The language/framework war

Once upon a time, before I truly understood the world of programming, I subscribed to the idea that some languages and frameworks were definitively better than others.

The truth is that every language have their use cases. Some intend to do A/B/C well while others aim to do X/Y/Z well. Some of them do what they aim to do, others do more, some don't hit the mark!

The more you learn about code, you'll find yourself building opinions; the longer you code, you'll find those opinions shifting and changing.

## How to enter the vast world of coding

There's a lot of areas of programming. I have spent most of my programming career in the world of Web Development—building websites across the whole stack (frontend, backend, database, etc.).

In this section, I'll point out the primary areas within web development. I'd recommend starting with one and building to the others. I will also describe the learning path that I took (which worked out quite well for me, truthfully).


### Web Development

Here are the primary categories that you'll see when people talk about web development:

- Frontend web development
  - There are truthfully two different sides of frontend work: (1) Design and (2) functionality.
  - Frontend developers are responsible for the look, feel, and interactivity of websites as non-programmers know about websites. When you click a button, does it do something? A frontend (functionality) dev wrote the code that made that button *do the thing*. When you resize your browser, does the picture adjust? A frontend (design) dev made it look that way!
- Backend web development
  - Backend devs are responsible for creating the more data-oriented side of websites. When you purchase a new tee shirt... does your card get charged? When you follow someone on instagram... do they show up in your "followed" section when you return to the app? When you make an Amazon purchase... does the item show up in your past orders? All of this is driven by data, and a lot of complex code that gives meaning to that data. A backend dev made that happen.
- Fullstack web development
  - This is simply where a developer covers both frontend and backend. It takes on a lot of different "versions". For instance, I am a fullstack developer with a backend-heavy lean. I primarily work in the backend, but I do a lot of *functional* frontend work. I am very rarely responsible for making some site look pretty... the frontend work I do is more about interacting with the backend API and shaping that data into something meaningful for the end user. (I avoid CSS and design as much as humanly possible, simply because I prefer functionality coding over design!)


### How did I learn how to code? (Sparknotes overview of my coding journey)

1. **[Summer 2019] Rafting and coding?**\
With 0 coding knowledge, I was tasked to work on Google Sheets scripts (Google's variation of JavaScript) that drove our rafting company's scheduling spreadsheet. I immediately fell in love with the puzzle of working out problems with code.
2. **[Summer 2019] Learn Python**\
Python was my first language. I learned through [Codecademy's "Learn Python 3" course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3), which was wonderful.
1. **[Fall 2019-Spring 2020] CompSci Major (Freshman year)**\
I committed to Belmont University for college before I knew I wanted to code. I switched my major to CompSci; I was 1 of 30 CompSci majors at the university. While I was at Belmont, I learned Object Oriented Programming principles in several classes. We used Java.
1. **[Summer 2020] Self-taught web dev (post-freshman year summer)**\
Belmont's CompSci program was lacking. I planned to transfer to CU Boulder for CompSci. I spent this summer learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and *a small bit* of backend programming. I used [Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer career path](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/). Would recommend.
1. **[Fall 2020–Spring 2021] Coding Bootcamp: Lambda School**\
Covid happened and (like many others) changed my plans. It didn't make sense to pay $60k for CU Boulder if I were to be remote. Instead, I attended Lambda School, a coding bootcamp. There, I  studied fullstack web development. I deepened my knowledge of CSS, HTML, JavaScript; I learned everything there is to know about React; and I learned Java Spring to build backend APIs.\
We also studied algorithms with an interview focus and went through "Labs" where we built actual products for real life stakeholders.
   1. I highly recommend the bootcamp path if you're willing to forego a classic college experience.
   2. Lambda School is now known as Bloomberg Institute... it's drastically different than when I attended and I would sadly no longer recommend folks attend. But! If you're interested in the bootcamp path, please contact me and I will happily provide some better recommendations.
1. **[Summer 2021] Job Hunt & Open Source work**\
While I was job hunting, I was also exploring other languages & frameworks. Simultaneously, I fell in love with Open-Source software. I worked on projects for RustLang (the open-source org behind the language of Rust) and did some work for a handful of cryptocurrency & blockchain startups.
1. **[Fall 2021–Now] Full Time Software Developer at The Motley Fool**\
I started with The Motley Fool in August of 2021. I've been there ever since and I've been happily working as a fullstack dev on their CommerceTech team. Our team primarily works in the backend with C# & ASP.NET ecosystem. Our primary frontend app uses Blazor. And we have several other applications that use Python and Django.

## My Primary Languages

### In Order of "Difficulty" (Easiest to Hardest)

*The following list is in order of “difficulty” as far as learning the language from Square 1 is concerned*

1. Python
2. JavaScript/TypeScript
3. C#
4. Java
5. Rust

### In Order of My Preference (Favorite to Least)

*The following list is purely opinionated. The order of preference has changed over the years, and there's a lot of aspects that go into these opinions*

1. Rust
2. C#
3. Java
4. JavaScript/TypeScript
5. Python

### In Order of Popularity (Most to Least as of 2023... as far as I know)

1. JavaScript/TypeScript
2. Python
3. Rust
4. Java
5. C#

## My Preferred IDEs

*Note: some folks use VS Code for absolutely everything.*
*I personally like the more tooled-up IDEs, so I change what IDE I’m using based on the language/framework*

- JavaScript/TypeScript — VS Code
- Python — JetBrains PyCharm (Professional)
- Java — JetBrains IntelliJ (Professional)
- C# —JetBrains Rider (Professional)
- Rust — VS Code
  - JetBrains CLion is also good for Rust... but most of the Rust community uses VS Code.

## Popular Frameworks

*Frameworks are an additional layer on top of programming languages. They have become a core part of development for most areas of programming.*

*While a language provides the syntax and rules to build an application, they usually don’t include any out-of-the-box native functionality that lets you DO something with it.*

*Frameworks give developers some pre-configured tools that allow you to actually DO the thing you want to do with the code.*

*Any options that are **bolded** are what I’d recommend for starting out with for that particular language/application-type*

### JavaScript/TypeScript

#### Front End

- **React**
- **VueJS**
- Svelte
- Angular — I’d recommend not using Angular to start with

#### Back End

- **Node.js**
- Next
- Express
- Gatsby

### Python

#### Front End

- **Django**

#### Back End

- **Django**
- FastAPI
- Flask

### Java

#### Front End

*Most folks do not build frontend web apps in Java. I’d encourage beginners to follow that same trend.*

#### Back End

- **Java Spring**

### C#

*Most folks do not build frontend web apps in C#. I’d encourage beginners to follow that same trend. That said, Blazor is my personal favorite frontend web framework… but if you’re just starting out with programming it’s better to go the JS/TS route*

#### Front End

- **Blazor**

#### Back End

- **ASP.NET**

### Rust

*Most folks do not build frontend web apps in Rust. I’d encourage beginners to follow that same trend.*

*Rust is growing on frontend usage, but most people stick to backend and lower-level stuff with Rust. You can hook up pretty much any JS/TS framework to a Rust backend.*

#### Front End

- Yew

#### Back End

- **Rocket**
  - There are other frameworks, but Rocket is hands-down the biggest Rust backend framework — I’d recommend starting with that and if you want some other recommendations hit me up
