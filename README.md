## My Primary Languages

### In Order of Difficulty (Easiest to Hardest)

*The following list is in order of “difficulty” as far as learning the language itself from Square 1 is concerned*

1. Python
1. JavaScript/TypeScript
1. Java
1. C#
1. Rust

### In Order of My Preference (Favorite to Least)

*The following list is purely opinionated. The order of preference has changed over the years, and there's a lot of aspects that go into these opinions*

1. Rust
2. C#
3. Java
4. JavaScript/TypeScript
5. Python

### In Order of Popularity (Most to Least as of 2023)

1. JavaScript/TypeScript
2. Python
3. Rust
4. Java
5. C#

## My Preferred IDEs

*Note: some folks use VS Code for absolutely everything.*
*I personally like the more tooled-up IDEs, so I change what IDE I’m using based on the language/framework*

- JavaScript/TypeScript — VS Code
- Python — JetBrains PyCharm (Professional)
- Java — JetBrains IntelliJ (Professional)
- C# —JetBrains Rider (Professional)
- Rust — VS Code

## Popular Frameworks

*Frameworks are an additional layer on top of programming languages. They have become a core part of development for most areas of programming.*

*While a language provides the syntax and rules to build an application, they usually don’t include any out-of-the-box native functionality that lets you DO something with it.*

*Frameworks give developers some pre-configured tools that allow you to actually DO the thing you want to do with the code.*

*Any options that are **bolded** are what I’d recommend for starting out with for that particular language/application-type*

### JavaScript/TypeScript

#### Front End

- **React**
- **VueJS**
- Svelte
- Angular — I’d recommend not using Angular to start with

#### Back End

- **Node.js**
- Next
- Express
- Gatsby

### Python

#### Front End

- **Django**

#### Back End

- **Django**
- FastAPI
- Flask

### Java

#### Front End

*Most folks do not build frontend web apps in Java. I’d encourage beginners to follow that same trend.*

#### Back End

- Java Spring

### C#

*Most folks do not build frontend web apps in C#. I’d encourage beginners to follow that same trend. That said, Blazor is my personal favorite frontend web framework… but if you’re just starting out with programming it’s better to go the JS/TS route*

#### Front End

- **Blazor**

#### Back End

- **ASP.NET**

### Rust

*Most folks do not build frontend web apps in Rust. I’d encourage beginners to follow that same trend.*

*Rust is growing on frontend usage, but most people stick to backend and lower-level stuff with Rust. You can hook up pretty much any JS/TS framework to a Rust backend.*

#### Front End

- Yew

#### Back End

- Rocket
  - There are other frameworks, but Rocket is hands-down the biggest Rust backend framework — I’d recommend starting with that and if you want some other recommendations hit me up
